- For this test I made a symfony project exposing 5 endpoints. For each endpoint the data and the result were given.
- A Postman collection is available to easily test all endpoints(./postman_collection.json).
- I reused the code from the previous level for each level to keep track of my work. I tried to factorize and handle errors in my code as best I could.
- I used the principles of OOP to achieve the levels.
